# UdpProject

The small project is written on the Qt. It's one of my homework's experiment.



## Main functions

* Chat with each other in the local area network
* Send files to other
* Show the online list

There are also many small functions to make the small tool easily to be used.


## The mainwindow

In the "images" folder, you can see pictures of the mainwindow on mac and win7.
